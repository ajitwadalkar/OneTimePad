Implementation of OneTimePad

To run the project from Linux terminal use following command

Here you will need to input the number corresponding to the function.
once the function is executed it will print the updated status of all the files.
once that part is done, the program will ask you if you want to re-run the program, you can select 1 to rerun it or 2 to terminate the program.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
Do you want to re-run the program?
Please choose from the following.
1. Yes
2. No

if you select 1 it will reprint the function menu and if you press 2 the program will terminate.

*I have added additional code in OneTimePad.java file to test 2 locations for the 'Data' folder. So mostly there will not be any issue regarding the data folder path.
